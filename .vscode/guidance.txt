some simple unix shell stuff that may make the rest of kafka lab more pleasant for yous
you can make a file executable with the command chmod
so in folder with .py files chmod a+x *.py makes all files ending in .py executable
the a+x means for  (a)ll users add(+) e(x)ecutable permission
so then ./consumer-to-SQL.py will run the file
you will also need to add #!python3 as the first line of the file 
the #! (called a hashbang) tells the shell what program to use to run the script. if you had a file that needed to be run with bash you would for example put #!/bin/bash as the first line and make it executable
this allows you to use text files as programs on the computer and saves you from for example running the file like so: python3 ./consumer-to-SQL.py
